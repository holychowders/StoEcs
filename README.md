# StoEcs -- Star Trek Online Embedded Control System
StoEcs is an independent project to create an embedded GUI control system for the video game Star Trek Online


## Vision

The end-goal of this project is to physically emulate a Star-Trek-like space exploration and combat experience through integrated digital control panels within a space-ship-like vehicle. The user will be able to view and control the status of their ship through these interfaces.

Inspiration is partially drawn from others' projects such as

and

The core difference of StoEcs is that it is (or will be when it's complete) fully interactive -- that is, a user's inputs produce tangible in-game effects, and game events produce consequences in the system.

### Other Notes

\- See the [Python version of this project](https://github.com/holychowders/sto_ecs), which is a little further developed. Note that I do not necessarily intend to "mimick" that version here in any way. The vision of the two projects is the same, but they are not the same projects.

\- I am **not** affiliated with the developers or publishers [Star Trek Online](https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/star-trek-online/). This is an independent project purely for learning and enjoyment.
